Docker is a containerization tool.

Virtualization -- Fixed hardware allocation.

Containerization - No Fixed Hardware

Process isolation ( Dependency in os is removed )

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In comparison to the traditional virtualization functionalities of hypervisors, 
Docker containers eliminate the need for a separate guest operating system for every new virtual machine.

Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. 

A Docker container enables rapid deployment with minimum run-time requirements. It also ensures better management and simplified portability.
 This helps developers and operations team in rapid deployment of an application.

How to check the docker is installed or not

# docker --version


We should be comformatable with four terms

1) Docker Images   
Combinations of binaries / libraries which are necessary for one software application.

2) Docker Containers  
When image is installed and in comes into running condition, it is called container.



3) Docker Host
Machine on which docker is installed, is called as Docker host.

4) Docker Client
Terminal used to run docker run commands ( Git bash )



On linux machine, git bash will work like docker client.
